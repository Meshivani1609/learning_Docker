//What is Docker Architecture & Container
/*
Docker is an open-source centralised platform designed to create, deploy and run applications.

Docker uses container on the host OS to run applicatins . It allows applications to use the same linux kernal as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.

we can install docker on any O.S but Docker engine runs natively on linux distribution.

Docker written in golang

Docker is a tool that performs OS level Virtualization, also known as Containerization


when we request to create a ubuntu container the request is sended to docker hub where it finds the image of ubuntu and it sends it to the container
Before Docker, many users faces the problem that a particular Code us running ih the developer's System but not in the User's System.

Docker is a set of platform as a service that use OS level Virtualization where VMware uses Hardware Level Virualization.

Image :-  conatiner takes 95% required software from OS and 5% required software from DOcker hub that 5% is known as image and then copies it

due to less percantage conatiner is lightweight
